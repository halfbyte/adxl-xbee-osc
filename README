ADXL > XBEE > OSC
-----------------

This is specialized code to read out an Xbee AD-Input to sample an ADXL breakout board from Sparkfun.

The acceleration data then is converted from XBee-Packets to OSC messages (to use it in PureData for example)

Additionally, every 100 samples, a message is sent containing the current battery level of the Xbee/ADXL combo.

Hardware schematics and more information probably coming soon.
